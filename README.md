# SVC_Model
A SVC (Static Var Compensation) model for a Educational usecase
To be used with a 110kV overhead line model operated at 1/1000 of the voltage.
Includes 3 TCC (Thyristor Controlled Capacitance) controlled via a 5V SELV control network, optionally a ATMega32U4 can be used for grid voltage regulation. A 5V PSU is included on board. There are no input filters to show the effect of a bad THDi.
